# Team 5: PowerWash: Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Contributors:** Tate Middleton, David Valarde, Jacob Kurry, Riley Sackett, Abiral Tuladhur

**Overview:**  
PowerWash is a streamlined tool designed to simplify the process of cleaning and analyzing datasets. By allowing users to upload a CSV through our intuitive front-end interface, PowerWash takes care of the heavy lifting in the background. Leveraging Python’s powerful Pandas library, the data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis.

Once the dataset is wrangled, users can visualize their data through a variety of plot types, including:
- Box plots
- Histograms
- Bar plots
- Scatter plots

These visualizations are created using Python’s Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. Additionally, PowerWash offers insights into the dataset’s granularity (primary keys), helping users better understand the structure of their data. 

The tool also allows users to export and present their findings in the form of slideshows, making it easy to share and communicate insights with others.
